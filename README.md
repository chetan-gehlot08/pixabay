# About App
A simple android pixabay image list application to demonstrate the usage for clean architecture with MVVM design pattern using Kotlin, Coroutines, Retrofit, LiveData, Databinding, Hilt(DI).

# Description
The depdendencies for the project are described in the Gradle script build.gradle of the app, just sync the project in Android Studio and you are ready to go :)

# Components Used
MVVM Architecture - Robust, testable, and maintainable app with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data persistence.
Coroutines - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
Dagger hilt - Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
AndroidX - AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library
Data Binding - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements. 
Lifecycles - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events. 
LiveData - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying state changes.
Glide - A fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android
